# Restaurant

Android App Restaurant app with JSON requests 

Four different activites. The first is of the restaurant's main courses, then the options are accessed by clicking on those courses, 
taking you to a information page on each of the course, with the price and description. If the submit button is clicked, the 
platters are added to your order and you are re-directed to the orders page. On the orders page you can check your order and you are 
given a waiting time until it will come to you. If you click on your orders again, they can be deleted.
